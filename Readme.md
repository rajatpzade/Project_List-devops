   - Securely deploy a food delivery application.
   - Implement DevSecOps best practices.

9. **[Jenkins CI/CD for Python WebApp](https://mrcloudbook.com/ci-cd-devsecops-project-with-jenkins-python-webapp/)**
   - CI/CD pipeline for a Python-based web application.
   - Integrate security scanning tools.

10. **[CI/CD Pipeline for Uptime Kuma (Server Monitoring)](https://mrcloudbook.com/ci-cd-pipeline-for-uptime-kuma-get-real-time-call-alerts-for-server-downtime-open-source-monitoring/)**
    - Deploy a monitoring solution with real-time alerts.
    - Implement DevSecOps practices for security and resilience.

## General Setup Instructions
Each project follows a structured approach:
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```
2. **Set up dependencies** (Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Ansible, etc.)
3. **Configure CI/CD pipelines** as per project-specific instructions.
4. **Run security scans** using tools like SonarQube, Snyk, and Trivy.
5. **Deploy the application** to the appropriate cloud or on-prem environment.
6. **Monitor and maintain** with logging and alerting solutions.

## Key Learnings
- **CI/CD Pipeline Development**: Automating build, test, and deployment workflows.
- **Security Best Practices**: Implementing DevSecOps methodologies.
- **Cloud & Kubernetes Deployments**: Managing infrastructure as code.
- **Automated Monitoring & Alerting**: Using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Infrastructure Automation**: Leveraging Ansible and Terraform for provisioning.
